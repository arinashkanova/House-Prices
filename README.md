# Description

This project based on [kagggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).  
This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition. 

**Practice Skills:**
-  Primary analysis and preprocessing data;
-  Creative feature engineering;
-  Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.
